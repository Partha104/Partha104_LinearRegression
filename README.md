## General Information
- The project is to study a data set build a multiple linear regression model for the prediction of demand for shared bikes
- What is the background of your project?
- A US bike-sharing provider BoomBikes has recently suffered considerable dips in their revenues due to the ongoing Corona pandemic. The company is finding it very difficult to sustain in the current market scenario. So, it has decided to come up with a mindful business plan to be able to accelerate its revenue as soon as the ongoing lockdown comes to an end, and the economy restores to a healthy state. In such an attempt, BoomBikes aspires to understand the demand for shared bikes among the people after this ongoing quarantine situation ends across the nation due to Covid-19. They have planned this to prepare themselves to cater to the people's needs once the situation gets better all around and stand out from other service providers and make huge profits.

- What is the business probem that your project is trying to solve?
- Need to show the dependent variable that is related with the independent varaibles, so that business can take decisions to increase revenue
- What is the dataset that is being used?
Excel data containing 30 columns and 730 records
<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
Modeling was done and the dependednt variables were also mentioned which are major factor for the target variable and has a impact on the business majorly
